### Information

This mod is mainly for R.E.P.O game testers therefore some features are turned off by default so I'd recommend checking the config is configured how you want it.

### Features

- Debug Commands
  - Config option to enable the base-game debug console which is accessible via the grave key (`)
    - You can scroll up and down with the up/down arrow keys or scroll wheel. Also when an option is selected you can press tab to complete it
    - You can use middle mouse click to redo the previous command you executed
    - Items & valuables spawn at the closest level point whilst enemies spawn in a room nearby
- Fast Startup
  - Config option to skip moon phase animation
  - Config option to skip splash screen (This only activates after you've seen the full splash screen at least once)
- Player Name Prefixes
  - This adds name prefixes for the game's developers and testers
    - If you are one of the R.E.P.O testers and don't see the option for the tester prefix please let me know

- Saves
  - [Host] Config option to disable save file deletion
  - [Host] Config option to enable save files for public lobbies
- Server List
  - Made searching for a steam lobby id in the search list attempt to join the lobby
